Summary:
My Final Project is a Text Adventure Game.

The main audience for this project is actually one specific user: my girlfriend's 4 year old son.

He loves Egyptian lore, treasure maps, ninjas, Star Wars, dancing to Michael Jackson music, and cobras (He calls them "cobra snakes").

I originally intended this to be a game based on Raiders of the Lost Ark, so I combined my favorite movie and added Damien and my dog, Bento, to be the main protagonists.

He loves to read. So, the game is meant to be read to him as a choose your own adventure book that his mother and I can read to him. 

There are tons of inside jokes and things that don't make sense to an outside user. Ninja and Darth Vader ghosts, my cowardly dog, references to other fun jokes and adventures him and I have.

This game intentionally has no game over state given that he is only 4 years old. A 4 year old would become frustrated with losing over and over and this game is already a little over his head. So, each failure state just loops back to the question.

It is also very linear by design. This is meant to be short and sweet and keep his attention span. A real text adventure game bores maany adults, let alone 4-year-old.

The game is case sensitive and spelling matters! 

If you type your name in as Damien at the beginning when prompted, you get a different response than if you would type it on your own. 

One level in this game was cut due to scope creep and time restrictions. It is commented out in the script.

The game is also intentionally non-violent in it's narrative and kind of goofy. This is for the intended audience and generally how I like to make my games. 

I hope you like it!
